>[!check]
>- There's a video trailer explaining all aspects of this project in twitter, you can watch it [from here]().

- **Marvel verse** is an iOS mobile application through which you can explore the **Marvel Universe**, search for comic, read the available series, navigation through every Marvel event and learn more about your favorite characters.
- It fetches the data directly from the [Marvel API](https://developer.marvel.com).
- The app's main components are :
	1. Main view.
	2. Side menu.
	3. And a navigation bar at the top consisting of a search bar and two buttons - one for the menu and the other one for the saved items.

- The first view you'll get to see when you launch the application is the **Comics** page and see, you can scroll though the $30,000+$ comics written by Marvel or you can search and find exactly what you want.

### Details Pages
- Clicking on an item in any of the four main pages will take you to its **Details page**. There you can find more information about it and you can find one or two buttons at the bottom of the **Details page** depending on the item.
- Each one of these buttons will take you directly to Marvel's website to execute on of these three options :
	1. Reading more about the item - (**Details button** $\implies$ Comics, Series, Events, Characters).
	2. Purchasing the selected items - (**Purchase button** $\implies$ Comics).
	3. Exploring the comic in which the selected character was involved - (**Comics button** $\implies$ Characters).
